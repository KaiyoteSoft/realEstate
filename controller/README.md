Sample app developed for DeveloperWeek Hackathon. Interface to
[Kaiyotesoft's real estate mockup](http://kaiyotesoft.github.io/realEstate/).

Requirements

* Pygame  
* Python 2.7.
* requests Python module

This assumes that the demo program is running in a sub-directory of the
site and simply saves the 360 images to the same directory structure
as the 360 images and JavaScript. We're anticipating that the Hackathon
will have spotty WiFi and wanted to keep the files local.
If you want to use this as a proof of concept, you'll need to modify
your code to move the image files to an external server.

Usage: realestate.py
